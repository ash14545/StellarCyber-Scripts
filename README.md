# StellarCyber-Scripts

StellarCyber-Scripts is a CLI-based menu interface with dynamic options loaded from a `project.json` file. It allows users to navigate through a menu structure, execute scripts, and display help information. This project is outdated and will not be updated much. Please use the new [StellarCyber-Scripts-Pro](https://github.com/ash14545/StellarCyber-Scripts-Pro) project.
